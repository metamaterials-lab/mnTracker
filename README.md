# Multi-nodal Visual Tracking Tool (mnTracker)
This tool is based on Kernelized Correlation Filters (**KCF**) for Visual Object Tracking (**VOT**). Refer to [1] for more information regarding this topic. The tool is build using **Python 3.11** and third-party dependencies, such as: Numpy [2], OpenCV [3], PyQT5, and Matplotlib [4].
## Requirements
Here a list of requirements for utilizing this tool:
-  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional).
-   [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/).
- Third-party dependencies. This will be installed automatically.
## Installation
Make sure you have access to python and git from the command line
> git --version
> python --version

You should see something like this:
> git version 2.38.1.windows.1
> Python 3.11.1

Clone this repository in your PC. If you have git, use the following command, otherwise download the .zip version.
> git clone https://github.com/LuisDFJ/mnTracker-mml.git & cd mnTracker-mml

Run the installer (from the command-line or from the file explorer).
> .\install.bat

Run the following command to confirm that your installation was succesful.
> .\check.bat

You should be prompted with something like:
> contourpy == 1.0.7
> cycler == 0.11.0
> fonttools == 4.39.0
> kiwisolver == 1.4.4
> ...
> python-dateutil == 2.8.2
> six == 1.16.0

Now, is time to run the tool.
> .\run.bat

Enjoy! :smile:
